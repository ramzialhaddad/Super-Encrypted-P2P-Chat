# Super Encrypted P2P Chat System

This repository hosts 2 types of encryption, a joke that I found on r/ProgrammerHumor and proper AES Symmetric encryption.

**Note: Proper encryption will only work in linux, I tried to trouble shoot with windows but scockets aren't very intuitive to use, so if you do have a solution then make a pull request or issue**
